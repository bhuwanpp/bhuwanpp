# Hi, I am Bhuwan Paudel

- 🖥️ I have been coding Javascript for almost a year.
- 🧑🏻‍💻 I am learning TypeScript and NextJs at the moment.
- 🕊️ you can follow me on Twitter [@Bhuwanpp](https://twitter.com/Bhuwanpp).

I've been enjoying web development for the first time since
I clone popular website (like facebook, w3school) using HTML and CSS.
I love it because I can recreate the frontend part of the websites that I use
daily.

I am currently on the look out for a role in Frontend Development,
ideally writing **ReactJs** ⚛️.If you're hiring ,let's chat!
