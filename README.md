# Hi, I am Bhuwan Paudel

- 🖥️ I have been coding Javascript for almost a year.
- 🧑🏻‍💻 I am learning TypeScript and NextJs at the moment.
- 🕊️ you can follow me on Twitter [@Bhuwanpp](https://twitter.com/Bhuwanpp).

My fascination with frontend has grown as I explored HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and since I’ve
started playing around with those technologies, I’ve become even more excited about the idea of a
Frontend role.

I am currently on the look out for a role in Frontend Development,
ideally writing **ReactJs** ⚛️.If you're hiring ,let's chat!
